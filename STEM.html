			<h3>INTRODUCTION</h4>
			<p class="main__text-description">
				I was researching evaluation tools in class. I discovered that if you fill a PET bottle with water, add a few drops of floor
				wax, and shine a flashlight on it,the bottle will shine brightly. I knew that it could lead to figuring out why the sky
				was blue, so I decided to look into it.

			<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
			<p class="main__text-description">
				To find how much light passes though a liquid.<br></br>
         To study the effect of diferent lights travel though a liquid.
        </p>

        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <ol class="method">
          <li>Line up 26 PET bottles</li>
          <li>Put the water into the platic bottles</li>
          <li>Put 5 drops of floor wax. I used floor wax because the particles are small.</li>
          <li>Place the flashlight behind the bottles</li>
          <li>Change the color of the flashlight and count how many plastic bottles does the light pass through</li>
          <li>Evaluate which color light passes though a longer or shorter distance</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>How to evaluate the color?</h3>
          <ol class="evaluatecolor_list">
          <li>Draw the straight line</li>
          <li>Evaluate the color of 
          the middle of the plastic 
          bottle on the line.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="main__text-description">For the camera used, the aperture and exposure were constant, but the shutter speed was not the same. This graph illustrates the sum of the RGB values compared to the number of PET bottles in the line. <br></br><img class="img-result2" src="image/graph.png"alt="result">
          According to this graph, we can see that the blue and green light has the highest decrease in intensity ratio than red light. The red light ‘s intensity ratio is slowly decreasing.

      <h3>Color Code</h3>
      <img class="img" src="image/RGB-color-model.jpg"alt="RGB color chart">
      <p class="main__text-description">
       It is a hexadecimal number that represents a color. 
       The color is determined by the ratio of the three light color:red green and blue.#RRGGBB→#FFFFFF(white),#000000(black)<br></br>
       Intensity ratio is a sum of red, blue, and green values expressed as a decimal number.#ffffff→255+255+255→765

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <img class="img" src="image/result.png"alt="result">
      <p class="main__text-description">
        From my observations, blue and green light were brighter thoug the beginning PET bottles. Therefore, I assumed that these colors scatter easier compared with other colors.<br></br>
        On the other hand, red did not scatter. The red light travels in an almost straight line. This means that, red is a color that is diffcult to scatter.

      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <img class="img-result " src="image/dis result.png"alt="result">
      <p class="main__text-description">
       This graph illustrates the ratio of red, green, and blue light found in white light. Blue light is scattered first, while red light travels farther. At the end of the line of bottles, the ratio of blue light is the lowest. This is because red light has a lower frequency and attenuate slower

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p class="main__text-description">
       I could observe that blue light scattered easier than red light. I found that different lights have different frequencies and attenuation rate.In the future, I want to experiment again after taking the details into account.<br></br>
